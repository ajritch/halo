Halo is an app built for the 24-hour Hack Homelessness Hackathon in San Jose, CA in September, 2016. This app uses facial recognition to recognize individuals and to interact with our database to provide information necessary to medical services personnel.

To run this app, download or clone this repository, insert API credentials (Kairos Facial Recognition), and connect to your localhost server.
